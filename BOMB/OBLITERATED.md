# BOMBs Away!

Congratulations!  It looks like you, or a friendly colleague, has called in an air-strike... a call for `cleanup-in-ISLE-one-please`.  This file, `OBLITERATED.md` is the crater (debris) left by the BOMB.  Its sole purpose here is to replace a directory, or perhaps a single file, that was identified as USELESS cruft in your ISLE stack.

## Rationale for the BOMB

In March 2019 the bomb's inventor, Mark McFate (Grinnell College), was driven over-the-edge (he went absolutely berserk) sifting through all the complexities an insanely long paths of FEDORA 3 and Solr configurations!  Ultimately he built https://github.com/DigitalGrinnell/cleanup-in-ISLE-one-please and this BOMB to dispatch all the 'useless' cruft, leaving only the 'necessary' cruft behind.

### Theory: The Effects of Prolonged Exposure to 'Useless' Java Cruft

Non-scientific and highly-suspect tests conducted by the aforementioned lunatic not only drove him nuts, they also instilled in him a deep hatred for all things Java.  Mark won't even drink coffee, presumably because it is frequently referred to as `java`.

*Don't be a victim like Mark.  Use the BOMB!  OBLITERATE the cruft!*

### Where to Find All the 'Necessary' Cruft

Try `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/fedoragsearch/WEB-INF/classes/fgsconfigFinal` for starters.  Happy hunting!
